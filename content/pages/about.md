<p>I am a writer and translator living in the Rhineland. My jam is science fiction and fantasy, and I'm worried about the Great Filter. Don't believe these dour posts: I am an eternal optimist.</p>

<p>Look for my forthcoming story "Smallpox Ate the Americas Once" in Issue 6 of ![Factor Four Magazine](http://factorfourmag.com/)\!</p>

<p>I seldom wear hats.</p>
