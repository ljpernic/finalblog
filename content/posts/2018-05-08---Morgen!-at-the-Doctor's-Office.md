<p>Germans aren’t rude, they’re just polite in different ways. When a German enters the waiting room at a doctor’s office, they always say, <em>“Morgen!”</em> (good morning), and everyone mumbles it back. It’s oddly personal for Germans, so famous for their aloofness, like they’re saying, “Oh, you’re sick? Me too! Today we are not strangers.” </p>

<p>The buildings of Germany no longer serve the function they once did. That’s not always true--there’s an <em>Apotheke</em> that’s been dispensing drugs on the Markt for 400 years--but for the most part, companies squeeze into the spaces available to them. I don’t know what the eye doctor’s office once was, but now it’s a row of rooms along one second-floor wing of a building in the <em>Innenstadt</em>. The waiting room is a single long wooden bench in the hallway, and you really have to shout for your <em>Morgen!</em> to be heard, the mumbled replies like the wave at a football game, traveling the length of the hall at the poor man’s speed of sound. It doesn’t matter the shape of the room, the arrangement of benches or chairs. You always say hello. </p>

<p>I wonder what the limit is. If the waiting room were the size of an airport hangar, would they get out the bullhorn to unleash their <em>Morgen!</em> into the echoing hall? </p>

<p>I’m foreign, and when I enter a waiting room, I say nothing. The people there all look up expectantly, waiting for the social niceties that keep us civilized, those things the rest of the world pretends don’t exist in over-serious Germany. And when I say nothing, they turn back to their magazines thinking what a jerk I am, and I can’t help but think they’re right. We foreigners really must be ruining Germany. </p>

<p>But it’s anathema to my culture to talk to strangers at the doctor’s office. Things are catching there. Everything except the harmless social nicety that is <em>Morgen!</em></p>
