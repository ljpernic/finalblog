When I was small, an angel appeared in the ditch behind our house. She was a Christmas decoration, three feet tall and made of plastic. Sometimes we gathered to throw rocks at her, aiming for the hole in her back where a light must have gone. I thought I thought I thought she belonged to my neighbor who built elaborate decorations every year until one year she didn't, and even as a child I felt bad for the symbol, this perfect thing brought low, an angel fallen like they said at Catechism, evil evil evil, when all I felt was pity. I even managed to feel bad for my neighbor who I thought had had her angel stolen, not knowing the truth till years later that she'd put up a choir of angels on her lawn, sure, only to find the next morning that they had multiplied, and where once there were three now stood four, a party crasher, uninvited. It was her who'd chucked that fallen thing into the muck, its fixed eyes staring at the dark culvert beneath the railroad tracks, waiting for the flood that washed it and us away. Even now I wonder where it's gotten to. And where my neighbor has too. That Angel of Arabi.
