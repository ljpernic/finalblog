Last week hot air surged up from Africa and coated Western Europe in sweat, and I went to Frankfurt for a bachelor party. We stopped in Koblenz for the Bachelor to visit his family, and the city was lovely, the <em>Altstadt</em> nestled between the Moselle and Rhine. The heat hadn't quite come, and I spent hours strolling around and reading <em>Beneath the Sugar Sky</em>, by Seanan McGuire. 

The nicest part of Koblenz? Taking a ferry across the Rhine to the foot of the fortress there. 

The strangest part of Koblenz? I saw a woman throw her drink in someone's face.

I met back up with the Bachelor and we climbed into his car, a two-seater convertible with no AC. The road was a furnace and we sweated through our clothes, but we made it to Frankfurt without trouble.

And then things went off the rails. 

Before I got married, Frau and I got all our friends a fake Bible with a flask inside full of booze, and the Bachelor is a big whiskey drinker, so I bought him one too, a kind of bachelor party kick-off present. We met up with his other friends and I took it out and told them, "Before we start, I think we should pray," and I handed him the fake book and he opened it, saw the flask, looked at me inscrutably, and set it back on the table. 

No mention of the flask was made again.

We caught the train after 9pm and got a fancy steak, and I'd brought enough money for us to split the Bachelor's bill, but no one would let me pay. For anything. They refused my money all night, in fact, and I have no idea why.

We went to a <em>Kulturfestival</em> by the opera house and then to a dive bar, and one of our party members kept pushing beer on us, but the heat was making my head hurt and I didn't want to drink it, and then he told us he's an alcoholic, no joke, and he drinks every day, and then I <em>definitely</em> didn't want to drink it, so they let me sit out two rounds of beer, and then the third I secretly poured in a urinal. Alcoholism was the trigger that detonated my first family and I still live among that rubble. It was a cry for help, but I didn't know what else to do but hide. 

We Went to a strip club after 1am. If the night wasn't weird enough, the performances involved dragging men on stage, stripping them to their underwear, spanking them with belts, and pouring hot wax on their chests. This is not to yuck someone else's yums, but it was not my bag. 

At last I was allowed to buy a round of beer. 

By 2:30, I was ready for bed, but the Bachelor insisted I come to a techno party, so we piled into a taxi. The venue seemed cool, and the swelling crowds were having a blast, but the night was over for me. Everyone was sweaty and on drugs and two strangers beside me sat groping each other, and it was all an authentic techno party experience, but I split and walked deserted streets past creepy people literally hiding in bushes to the S-Bahn station, and took the train back to my hotel.

The next day, we were on the road by noon, and as we slowly roasted in the car, the three hours we needed to get back to Aachen like a timer on a turkey, I questioned the wisdom of riding with someone who 6 hours earlier was fall-down drunk. I kept saying, "I can navigate, I can navigate," but he held his phone on his knee as he steered, and we shouted out our conversation above the roar of the road and the wind, and somehow everything was right and good. Three weeks before we leave this land, I finally got it:

An authentic <em>deutscher Junggesellenabschied.</em> 

But I'm not sure you could convince me for a second go-round.
