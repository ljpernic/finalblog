<p>Frau's contractions began at midnight, and by 6 a.m. we were on the bus to the university hospital at the edge of town. Puke-green and crowned with scaffolding and pipes, the place looks like a medieval castle built by Andy Warhol. The delivery rooms are tucked into one corner of the sub-sub-basement, with sliding barn doors dividing the concrete and fiberglass space. This is where Boo was born.</p> 

<p>Midwives are a professionally-trained and medically-educated force in Germany, and ours was no different. She was what one expects of a German medical practitioner: stern but to purpose, a General marshaling us hapless troops, Boo included. After half a day of waiting, the baby began its tunneling to freedom a la Andy Dufresne, and the midwife beckoned me to Frau's business end, saying, "You can feel zhe head! Go on, touch eet!" We demurred, but she insisted. "Touch eet! Touch eet!"</p> 

<p>Boo's hair was matted with goo, and her head felt so soft. It was the first time I touched her, wedged there between peristaltic muscles squeezing her like toothpaste from a tube.</p>

<p>Labor lasted 14 hours, but it felt to me like a blur. At the end of it, Boo was but a few hard pushes away, and Frau was screaming high and loud, the midwife shouting, "Shtop screeeming und poosh!" and all I could do was perch at Frau's shoulder like an anxious parrot, squawking whatever came to my tiny bird brain, and then</p>

<p>Boo was suddenly just there. </p> 

<p>She must have inherited my big head, for as soon as it cleared, the rest rocketed out, and she lay on the mat, tongue sticking out, arms clenched to her chest. She was chalk white but purpling like hypercolor until she was from head to toe a color to rival the placenta. I'm told that's normal. They let me cut the cord, and the midwife was all smiles and congratulations then, and Frau put the tiny babe against her bare chest and I managed to hold it together until the workers left to give us a moment alone with our newborn.</p> 

 <p>Then I cried.</p> 
 
 <p>They came back and gave her a scrubbing and a bonnet and that was it. We were parents.</p>
 
 <p>A good friend of mine and his wife had their baby yesterday, and I can't help but wonder how similar their experience was. I wonder how it can be that a thing so universal can be so different for so many people and in so many places. And I wonder, in spite of that difference, if there isn't something the same underlying each and every birth--the fear, the pain, the tension, the relief. The metaphysicochemical essence of love.</p> 
 
 <p>Mazel tov and congratulations.</p>
