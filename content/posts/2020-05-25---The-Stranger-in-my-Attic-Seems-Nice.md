The quarantine has gotten so bad that I've had to befriend the stranger who lives in my attic. We used to have an arrangement: I'd pretend not to notice his piercing eyes tracking me from the vents, the rustle of his clothes as he squeezed through the gaps behind my walls, the scuff of his shoes--and he'd not murder me in my sleep. 

That's all over now.

We started things slow--leftovers vanishing from the fridge, floorboards creaking in the attic, the occasional bloody hand print. Now the faint stink of tobacco permeates each room, mingling with mournful songs after the lights dim--sad odes out of key to a lost love living in an attic three blocks over, the gulf of social distancing yawning between them like the endless salty sea.

Then came the whispered good mornings and good nights, the faint bless yous when I sneezed that evaporated so quickly that I convinced myself the words were only in my head, the product of boredom and fatigue after seven weeks of isolation--at least until the next morning when a fresh box of tissues appeared at the bottom of my stairs, the attic-man's rapt attention pulsing through the grate of the vents, the focus of a novice gift-giver making me sweat as he dissected my reaction and supped on its different slices of apprehension and fear and gratitude all pressed together like a Christmas roulade.

I could hear him up there licking his fingers, and I wondered where he found the tissues, admired his resourcefulness when I've been using scraps of old newspaper to wipe my bum.

Today I came downstairs and there he was, sitting in my favorite chair, his dirty feet propped on my coffee table, splintery fingers cycling through my Netflix with abandon, nails bitten down to the quick.

His name is Harold. He likes Tiger King.
