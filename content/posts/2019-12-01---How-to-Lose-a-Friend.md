Drive two hours to pick them up from the airport and show them what New Haven has to offer. Take them to the Peabody Museum to see the dinosaur bones. Bring them up East Rock for the bird's eye view of town. Take them to Mystic, an hour away, to see the seaport and climb on the old ships there. 

Invite them into your home and offer them your bed while you take the sofa. Say nothing as they spend each evening farting loudly into the cushions where you will rest your face. 

Be gracious when they treat you to a night on the town, when they spend an outrageous amount of money as you pub crawl through the college bars of New Haven. Remember this night and hold it close to your heart. It will be the last good time you spend together.

Make them dinner each evening and buy all the groceries for the week. Enjoy Thanksgiving, break bread, and eat turkey. When everyone is full, craft an itinerary of all the things they want to see in New York City. 

Miss the train and arrive in New York 30 minutes later than planned. When they complain about the lost time, suggest they look on the bright side. Navigate them through the city. Give them all the cash in your wallet so that they can buy their kid some water and a pretzel.

Have them shout at you in the lobby of the Empire State Building for walking too fast and for your suggestion that they buck up. 

Feel that moment of panic as they loom, their body tense, their feet apart, their hands shaking. Recognize that they are 8 inches taller and 100 pounds heavier and could hurt you, really physically hurt you. Be reminded of nothing more than when you were little and your own dad raged. Feel that sense of bewilderment, that feeling of *what did I do?*

Do your best to calm them. Arrange your limbs and turn your body so that nothing in your posture could be construed as aggressive. Speak quietly. Suggest seeing the next item on your list.

Lead them through subway stations and across parks as they answer everything you say to restore the breach with a grunt or mumbled *okay*.

Cry when they try to apologize later, after a day of feeling like shit, like you're being made to work for someone's affection.

Try to bring things back to status quo the next morning, your final day together. Nod through their grunted monosyllabic replies and try again and again and again as you navigate them through the city for the final things on their list. 

Make one last desperate attempt to fix things by bringing up all the fun stuff you've done that week--the museum, the seaport, the Rock, Thanksgiving. Mention the things you can do next time, when you see them again.

Try not to cry when they say nothing, the implicit acknowledgement that no, there will be no next time. That one of your best friends of the last 5 years has dropped you in an instant, wrote you off like you were nothing. That the last time you'll ever see them is on the A train, when they don't even offer their hand to shake, when they barely mumble goodbye.

This is how to lose a friend.
