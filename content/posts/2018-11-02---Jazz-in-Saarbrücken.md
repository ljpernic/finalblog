<p>On Sunday we drove to Saarbrücken to see Paul Thibodeaux play. He's a drummer, and an old friend of Lydia's, though I've met him a handful of times over the years. Nicole Johänntgen is a saxophonist from Saarland, and she organized a band of New Orleans musicians, cut an album, went on tour. In a little restaurant tucked beneath a railroad bridge, I heard a slice of New Orleans I haven't been privy to in years, and besides making me desperately homesick, it got me thinking about authenticity and who has the right to call a thing their own. </p>

<p>In the last few years, I've come to realize how much effort I've wasted in trying to fit the things I love into narrow, definable categories, drawing lines on the ground like I could summon the devil himself. Like most of how I feel, I think it must come from Katrina, this obsession I have especially with defining what it is to be a real New Orleanian, as if to authenticate those aspects of my identity that seem so up for grabs, so open to interpretation. The city suffered, was destroyed, came back as something new and different and strange, though that in itself is a false perception since a city is never one thing, but many, not defined by the observer but interpreted, fitting what niches and nooks and holes we carry in our hearts, flexible to the point of breaking. But it's this feeling, however irrational, that if I could define what is and isn't New Orleans or its culture, and who's entitled to contribute to that distinction, I could take that solid this-is-it-and-that-is-not definition as something to wrap myself up in, like mud at the bottom of lakes and rivers and marshes to sink down into and cover myself up in and be part of a thing that knows me and that I know. That by defining it, I define myself. </p>

<p>It's stupid though. A stupid feeling, a stupid expectation, that authenticity is possible or even desirable. That the physical borders of Orleans Parish or the East Bank/West Bank divide or Chalmette vs. Mid-City vs. Kenner somehow defines not just political divisions but offers some clue to the rights and privileges of the interconnected cultures we share. It's laughable. New Orleans has it's physical boundaries, just like jazz has its conventions, Dixieland or Bebop or whatever, and in some sense that defines what they are, but not who is entitled to them. Authenticity isn't a label externally given, but something felt. And I felt it in Saarbrücken.</p>
