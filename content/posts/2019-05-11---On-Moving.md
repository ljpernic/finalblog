They say that doing something difficult together is the best way to make friends, that shared adversity forges unbreakable bonds. That's why if you ever want to befriend someone, you should help them move. 

There is no greater feat than lugging a sofa down a three-story walk-up, nothing so dangerous as double parking across the garage entrance of a 20-unit building, blocking traffic both ways as you stuff a full kitchen into the oversized van a friend borrowed from a coworker who _really_ needs it back by 6 o'clock. It's 4:30 now and tempers are fraying. 

Wars, natural disasters, moving apartments--these are the crucibles in which the strongest friendships are forged. So the next time an acquaintance seeks your aid, they're really saying, "Friend? Pshaw. _BROTHER_.

Also, can anyone help me move this Saturday?
