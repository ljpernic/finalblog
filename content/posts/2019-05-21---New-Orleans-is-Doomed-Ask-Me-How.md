Nearly everything I write concerns the apocalypse. Even after 14 years, I'm preoccupied with the destruction of New Orleans.

And I'm not hopeful.

I have this sinking suspicion that Katrina was a dress rehearsal, that the worst is yet to come. The problems we had in _the Before Time_ remain. Poverty, inequality, short-sightedness. The city hangs like a bad tooth in the mouth of the Mississippi River, and every speck of refuse upchucked by the vast US interior eventually arrives here. 

Somehow we've taken that fact to heart. You have to squint at times to see the city as anything but a place where tourists come to deposit their vomit in gutters. They have beer for breakfast, ride the mechanical bulls, fall down in the streets. And we say thanks for choosing us, come back real soon, y'hear? 

We're desperate for their pittance, while day by day our infrastructure crumbles and the waters rise.

Fully 20% of US oil refining capacity is in Louisiana, and that's a lot of cheddar cheese, but while they poison us with petrochemicals, they pay very little in taxes (a 12.5% severance tax that hasn't changed since 1974). Louisiana could be a paradise. New Orleans could be saved. But without concerted effort, both are doomed. We need only the will to put the money our state generates to better use.

So if it seems like I write a lot about the end of the world, it's only because I fear New Orleans won't exist in 100 years, and I'm preparing myself for the inevitable.

But even I have to admit: it'll be one hell of a party before it goes.
